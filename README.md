# **Write-Up**<br>
As a bio-science and a noobie when it comes to coding, Bi0s Get wired CTF has really helped me in many ways like using various
softwares and also getting hands-on experience with aurdino, ESP8266,etc<br>
Here, I would like to give a brief description about the challenges that I had sucessfully completed.<br>

## **Ain't no sunshine**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.A circuit was made using Aurdino Nano, jumper cables and a potentiom according to the diagram and was assembled. By varying the current flow.<br> 
through the potentio-meter, i was able to get an encryptted code. this was later decryptted using a crypt analyser.<br>
## **Find me**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.I searched the main social media handles, including FB, Instagram and finnaly was able to find the account from twitter or x. 
2.From this, I was able to find the Instagram page linked with this person.

for this challenge, <br>
1.The code was analysed and the pin connections were done according to the code to get the flag.<br>
## **Lost within robots**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.The laptop was conected to the Falcon badge using Wifi<br>
2.The IP address was identified and enterd to go to a site.<br>
3.In the site, the hint given was to search for the robots which visited the site.<br>

### flag- wired{z3d_1s_4w3s0m3_r16h7?}<br>
## **Dots and dashes**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.The sound was recorded using a mobile phone.<br>
2.This audio was heard and converted to morse code.<br> 
3.This was later analyzed using a morse code transliation software to be converted to the flag.<br>
### flag- wired{it_is_what_it-is}<br>
## **Achan's favorate**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.The given audio file was uploded to a spectrum analyzer.<br>
2.The graph obtained was the picture was of a person and his most iconic dialoge apperared.<br>
### flag- wired{steven_he}<br>
## **Gate Reversing**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.A diagram was drawn and using personal knowledge on gates.<br>
2.The input was identified by reversing the gates.<br>
## **Whats up doh**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.The file was openned using wire shark.<br>
2.Searched IDK567 to get a website name.<br>
3.This was searched to get a image with the name of the flag.<br>
## **Micro python** <br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.Connected the ESP8266 module to the laptop.<br>
2.Openned aurdino ide and opened the serial monitor.<br>
3.Adjusted the baud rate to get the flag.<br>
## **ESP ionage**<br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.Connected the laptop with the board via wifi.<br>
2.Got the IP address from wifi properties.<br>
3.Searched the IP address in the web browser to get a website.<br>
4.Got the encrypted flag from the AP of the website.<br>
5.Decrypted the flag using a Deciphering website.<br>
## **The french cipher** <br>
for this challenge, <br>
1. The given flag was deciphered using deciphering softwares. <br>
### flag- wired{w3lc0m3_t0_th3_w0rld_0f_c1phrs} <br>
## **Simple web** <br>
for this challenge, <br>
1.The given web was opened. <br>
